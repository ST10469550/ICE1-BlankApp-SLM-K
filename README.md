APP GOAL:


-The goal was to create a simple React Native component that
greets the user by name, using input provided through a TextInput field. 
The initial challenge was ensuring the dynamic input updated correctly and 
rendered the greeting in real time.


RESOLUTION APPROACH:
-To resolve promblem: app was not displaying Hello but only the user name

COULD NOT RESOLVE IT, THIS TIME THE CODE DID NOT EVEN RUN:

TO RESOLVE THIS :


-At first i got the APP Goal WRONG i did not understand it clearly
 now i got it right by start everything from strech create a new folder, new terminals
 once i was done i opened up App.tsx and ran the app only to discover that all i had to
 do was change the default text, to just follow instructions.
